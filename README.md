# HdM Client #

This is a client for the Stuttgart Media University API.

## Getting Started ##

First, you have to install the client:
```
npm install hdm-client
```

Now you can import it and create a client instance:
```
const Client = require('hdm-client');
const client = new Client();
```

This will use the default api url. If you want to use a different one, you can set the global host option like that:
```
const client = new Client({ host: 'https://myApi/v0/' });
```

Now you can use the client to access the api. Let's see where Mr Smith has his office:

```
client.searchDetails('person', 'Smith', {maxResults: 1}, function (err, result) {
    console.log(result[0].room);
});
```

## API ##

#### `constructor(options = { host: 'https://hdmapp.mi.hdm-stuttgart.de' })` ####
- `options {object}` - host, auth, maxResults

If options is a string, the host option will be set to this value. This is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. Don't do it.

#### `search(type, query, options, callback)` ####
- `type {string}` - all | room | person | event |lecture
- `query {string}` - Your search query
- `options {object}` - maxResults
- `callback {function}` - Called with the search result (error first)  

#### `details(type, id, options, callback)` ####
- `type {string}` - room | person | event | lecture
- `id {number}` - id of the ressource
- `options {object}` - None
- `callback {function}` - Called with the details (error first)

#### `menu(options, callback)` ####
- `options {object}` - None
- `callback {function}` - Called with the menu (error first)

#### `searchDetails(type, query, options, callback)` ####
- `type {string}` - all | room | person | event| lecture
- `query {string}` - Your search query
- `options {object}` - maxResults
- `callback {function}` - Called with the details of all search results (error first)

The client currently does not support authentication. That means that you won't find any students when searching persons.

### Options ###
#### `maxResults {number}` ####
Restricts the number of results that are presented to you. Used for `search` this does not improve performance, for `searchDetails` it does.

#### `host {string}` ####
Uses a custom API host.

#### `auth {object}` ####
Uses Basic Authentication. The object should have the keys 'user' and 'pass' or 'username' and 'password'.

### Running Tests ###

There are three scripts you can use to run tests and analyse the code:

- `npm test`: Runs all the unit tests
- `npm run coverage`: Provides information about the test coverage
- `npm run lint`: Runs JSHint (Rules can be found in `.jshintrc`)
- `npm run jscs`: Runs JSCS (Rules can be found in `.jscsrc`)
